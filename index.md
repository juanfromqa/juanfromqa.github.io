# Who am I?

I often describe myself as a tester in a developer's body, having the mindset to break things but the toolset to propose solutions.

I can ensure the quality of software while leveraging my coding abilities to build and utilize complex testing tools. I am proficient in all stages of the QA process from testing planning to post-release verification. I have worked with methodologies like Agile SCRUM and Waterfall.

QA is my passion and I would like to help whoever will find my skills suitable for their projects.
